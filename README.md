## Installation Options

If you're experiencing slow installation times, here are some alternatives:

### Option 1: Use a faster package manager
```bash
# Install pnpm (if you don't have it already)
npm install -g pnpm

# Then use pnpm instead of npm
pnpm install
```

### Option 2: Clone the repository directly
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/svsairevanth12/react-expo-refact-ai.git my-app

# Navigate to the project
cd my-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```
